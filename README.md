### Project Overview
This university project explores different methods of handling multiple tasks using processes and threads. It includes four main parts:

**Multi-Process Web Server**: A web server using multiple processes to handle client requests.

**Multi-Threaded Web Server**: A web server using threads for concurrent client handling.

**Comparison Report**: Analyzes the differences between multi-process and multi-threaded approaches, including performance, CPU usage, and memory consumption.

**Task Distribution System**: A multithreaded program simulating task processing across multiple units.

### Key Features
Implementation in C

Tracks runtime statistics such as CPU time and memory usage using gettimeofday() and getrusage()
Demonstrates process management, multithreading, and system resource tracking

This project was developed as part of a university coursework.
